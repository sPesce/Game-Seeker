Hello! And welcome to our App. Game Seeker!  Game Seeker is intended to provide you, the user with a means of
searching our up to the minute database of computer game deals for something to enjoy.  You can search for specific titles or view 
our top rated list (as defined by meta-critic score).  Game Seeker then provides a link to an online store where you can view/purchase
the game at it's best value!  

Our database of deals includes specific game title and store information so you can have it all under one window.  It's also updated at the time
of the application use with help from the CheapShark API, so you can game comfortably knowing you've got the best deal!

There is no need for additional software at this time, and everything can be accessed through the friendly command line interface we've provided 
for you.  Simply run the program (ruby run.rb) in your favorite terminal or code editor to begin!

This program uses the Cheap Shark api<br/>
